# Building
On linux or macos first install the [emscripten sdk](https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html) to your users home directory `~/emsdk`  
So you should have `/home/your_user/emsdk/emsdk_env.sh` file.  
And then run:
```
./bindings/js/configure.sh
./bindings/js/build.sh
```
on windows or if emscripten sdk is in different location check the above scripts and run the apropriate commands manually.  

The output files are in the root build directory (depthai-core/build):
```
build/bindings/js/depthai-js.js
build/bindings/js/depthai-js.wasm
build/bindings/js/depthai-js.d.ts
```
  
If something fails delete the build folder or the build folder and the ~/.hunter folder (maybe only the cache folder inside).

# Usage
check out the [bindings/js/example folder](example/README.md).

# Typescript support
There are autogenerated bindings available in `build/bindings/js/depthai-js.d.ts`
